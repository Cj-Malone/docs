Hello and Welcome to MapRoulette.

MapRoulette is a micro-task platform for OpenStreetMap. [MapRoulette.org](https://maproulette.org/) gives you small **Tasks** you can complete in under a minute to improve OpenStreetMap. Anyone can create groups of tasks, called **Challenges**, that the community can complete together.

Besides the website maproulette.org, there is also a full API that you can use to integrate MapRoulette with your own tools.

On this wiki, you will find all the resources you need to use MapRoulette.org, create and manage Challenges, see statistics and interact with the MapRoulette API.

Topics below that are not links yet are not written yet :( Help is welcome! If you have suggestions for this documentation, or don't understand how something works, please email us at maproulette@maproulette.org or [open a new issue](https://github.com/osmlab/maproulette3/issues).

_Links marked with ðŸ“• are OSM Diary entries._

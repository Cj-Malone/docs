title: Using Mapillary Images
description: 'We introduced a Mapillary overlay in version 3.1.1, but it was not so great to use yet. We have improved it a lot, it now shows Mapillary image locations that are more relevant to the task location, and we use the native Mapillary viewer widgets, so you can zoom in and easily skip to the next or previous images in a Mapillary sequence.'

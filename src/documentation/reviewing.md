title: MapRoulette 3.3 is out!
description: 'The biggest new feature in version 3.3 is the introduction of reviewing other mappers’ tasks. If you would like to have someone else review the tasks you complete, you can let MapRoulette know. If you’re an experienced mapper, you can volunteer to review other people’s work. In this post we explain how this works, and review some of the other goodies that made it into this version.'

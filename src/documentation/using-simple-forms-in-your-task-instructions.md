It may occasionally be useful to allow mappers to provide to Challenge owners some additional information as they work through tasks. MapRoulette now supports the ability to embed a very basic form in the Challenge Instructions, which mappers can optionally complete for each task. Responses are included in CSV and GeoJSON exports of the challenge.

To add form fields, simply setup one or more of the following templates in your Challenge Instructions:

> Note that template fields use _three_ curly braces instead of the usual two used for traditional mustache tags

### Checkbox field:

```js
{{ '{{{' | escape }}checkbox "Your checkbox label" name="myCheckbox"{{ '}}}' | escape }}
```

This will create a checkbox field named myCheckbox

> Note that field labels can also include basic markdown, including traditional mustache tags (with the normal two curly braces) referencing task properties

### Select (multiple-choice) field:

```js
{{ '{{{' | escape }}select "Your select label" name="myDropdown" values="foo,bar,baz"{{ '}}}' | escape }}
```

Creates a select field named my_dropdown with three choices (foo or bar or baz) plus an empty choice

> Note: the name you give to each field will be used as the column name in an exported CSV or property name in exported GeoJSON.
